-- Details --
-------------

-- Create core buildings --
Create melee, ranged, siege and scout buildings.


-- Link buildings to creeps --
Link the spawnability of the creeps to their respective buildings. i.e. that creep class spawns only when their respective building is on the map.


-- Enable creep upgrades --
Specifically, upgrades to the armor, health, damage and spawn count

-- Create custom scout --
There will be a land, air, and techies scout.


-- Clean up team and hero selection --
Players should be able to select what team they want to be on. It would also be nice to allow them to select their color/hero but if not possible then it can be auto assigned.


-- Enable normal and fast game modes --
The idea of fast mode is to allow players to reduce the average game time. Towers will have lower HPs and bounty will be increased.


-- Create new buildings and advanced tech upgrades --
Some ideas include:
Some kind of tech structure - a structure that allows the construction of advanced buildings and access advanced abilities
Purifier - a structure that increases your gold earned and upgradable to also increase your lumber earned
A hero structure - enables you to spawn hero creeps (for a cost each time you spawn a hero - A HERO HAS ENTERED THE BATTLEFIELD [print])
Defense structure - basic defense structure to attack scouts entering your base
Aerial creeps - flying creeps
AA creeps - well... creeps that shoot down aerial creeps
Stealth creeps - mmhmm
Stealth detect creeps - either have a special creep or have it as an upgrade to an existing creep
